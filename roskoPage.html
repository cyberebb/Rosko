		<h2>Adoption</h2>
		<p>I adopted Rosko from the National Mill Dog Rescue in Colorado. They rehabilate and rehome dogs saved from puppy mills. While most dogs need intensive training after they are rescued because of conditions in the puppy mill, Rosko adapted very well and did not need any training.</p>
